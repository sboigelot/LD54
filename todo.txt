	
create end screen UI with Star rating, replay button, and exit to menu

make people move a bit to dance?

create the second level (maybe use dialogic/panel to have the ex request to tank the wedding)

if time left:
	use Navigation2DService and agent to calculate movement path of attendee
	
	integrate some fitting music
	change the fonts
	add sound fx
	
	add achievements?
	
	Maybe we can have a spash title at the start of each phase?

	Make the z index of every element in movement on the map relative to the y position
